# EduFor

## Project Name:
EduFor - Educational Forum for Students

## Project Description:
We plan on making an educational forum where users can post questions about certain projects (such as if they needed help with a software engineering project). It could be posts about finding other people to collaborate with, or simple questions about how to do certain things. 

## Members:
- Joshua Rosner (Back-end)
- Alex Hu (Back-end)
- Varun Kambham (Front-end)
- Vedavyas Jampanaboyana (Front-end)

## Requirements:
- Backend: Golang
- Frontend: Node.js, Angular

## How to use the application:
- First, there are dependencies that need to be installed. For angular you can run "npm install" and for golang you have to run "go get".
- Once dependencies are installed, two seperate terminals are needed to run the backend and the frontend servers.
- On the first terminal, navigate to Edufor/frontend/ and run "npm run start".
- Once both of these are running, you can navigate to http://localhost:4200/ to access the website.
